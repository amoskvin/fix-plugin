# FIX Protocol Plugin

**[Install from JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/23052-fix-protocol)**

<!-- Plugin description -->
The FIX Protocol plugin makes it easier to read FIX Protocol messages.

Paste your log into a FIX [scratch file], or [associate] FIX with a file type, and you will get: 

- On-hover documentation for fields
- Inline hints with decoded tag names and values
- Color highlighting for detected FIX messages
- Highlighting for other instances of the field at the cursor

Additionally, you can [inject] FIX into a string in your code to get highlighting and on-hover documentation.
